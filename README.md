#### National Weather Service (NWS) Alerts

WeatherPulse integrates directly with the National Weather Service API to display real-time severe weather alerts for your location. **No custom components or plugins required!**

**How It Works:**
- Automatically uses your Home Assistant location coordinates (Settings → System → General → Location)
- Fetches alerts directly from `api.weather.gov` every 5 minutes
- Only displays alerts that are active for your specific location
- Alert section auto-hides when no active alerts exist

**Supported Alert Types:**
- 🌀 Hurricanes & Tropical Storms
- 🌪️ Tornado Warnings & Watches
- ⛈️ Severe Thunderstorm Warnings
- 🌨️ Winter Storm Warnings & Advisories
- 🔥 Heat Advisories & Excessive Heat Warnings
- 🌊 Flood Warnings & Flash Flood Warnings

- 🔴 **Extreme** (Red) - Life-threatening situations (hurricanes, major tornadoes)
- 🟠 **Severe** (Orange) - Severe weather threats (thunderstorms, winter storms)
- 🟡 **Moderate** (Yellow) - Moderate warnings (winter weather advisories)
- 🔵 **Minor** (Blue) - Minor advisories (frost, wind, heat)

**Alert Information Displayed:**
- Event name (e.g., "Tornado Warning", "Heat Advisory")
- Affected area/counties
- Headline summary
- Expiration time

Toggle "Show NWS Weather Alerts" in the visual editor's Display Options section.

**Note:** NWS alerts are only available for locations within the United States and its territories. The feature will gracefully fail for international locations without showing errors.

## ⚡️ Forecast Sensor Setup (Home Assistant 2024.2+)

With the latest Home Assistant weather model, forecast data (hourly/daily) is no longer available directly from weather entities.  
**WeatherPulse now uses a dedicated sensor to provide forecast data.**

### How It Works

- You create a [template sensor or automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/#sensor) that calls the `weather.get_forecasts` service.
- This sensor stores the forecast data in its attributes.
- WeatherPulse reads the forecast from your selected sensor, enabling hourly weather alerts.

### Example Automation

```yaml
- trigger:
    - platform: time_pattern
      minutes: "/30"
  action:
    - service: weather.get_forecasts
      data:
        type: hourly
      target:
        entity_id: weather.pirateweather
      response_variable: hourly
  sensor:
    - name: Pirate Weather Hourly
      unique_id: pirateweather_hourly
      state: "{{ hourly['weather.pirateweather'].forecast[0].condition }}"
      attributes:
        forecast: "{{ hourly['weather.pirateweather'].forecast[:24] }}"
```

### How to Use in WeatherPulse

1. **Create your forecast sensor** using the automation/template above.
2. **Select your sensor** in the WeatherPulse card editor under "Forecast Sensor".
3. **The card will use this sensor** for all forecast features (hourly/rain timing).

**Note:**  
- You must have a forecast sensor set up for hourly forecast features to work.
- The card will automatically detect available sensors with forecast data.

For more details, see [Home Assistant Weather Forecasts](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather/) and [Template Sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/#sensor).

#### Graphical Header Mode

The graphical header mode displays a large, immersive header with seasonal background images.

**✨ Bundled Images Included**: The card comes with beautiful default seasonal images! Just set `header_mode: graphical` and it works out of the box.

**Default Images**:
- 🌸 **Spring** - Cherry blossoms and tulips
- 🏖️ **Summer** - Tropical beach sunset
- 🍂 **Fall** - Autumn pumpkin and maple leaves
- ❄️ **Winter** - Snowy winter beach scene

**🎨 Use Alternate Bundled Images**:
The card includes multiple images per season. Switch to alternates in the visual editor or via YAML:
```yaml
seasonal_images:
  spring: /hacsfiles/weatherpulse/images/spring-alt1.jpg  # More tulips & flowers
  summer: /hacsfiles/weatherpulse/images/summer-alt1.jpg  # Sunset beach painting
  fall: /hacsfiles/weatherpulse/images/fall-alt1.jpg      # Autumn forest scene
  winter: /hacsfiles/weatherpulse/images/winter-alt1.jpg  # Snowy palm tree beach
```

**📁 Using Your Own Custom Images**:
1. Upload your images to `/config/www/images/` in Home Assistant
2. Reference them in the visual editor or YAML see config section below.

**Image Specifications** (for custom images):
- **Recommended size**: 800x280 pixels or larger
- **Format**: JPG (smaller) or PNG
- **File size**: Keep under 300KB each for fast loading

**Features**:
- **Auto-switching**: Backgrounds automatically change based on current season (Mar-May Spring, Jun-Aug Summer, Sep-Nov Fall, Dec-Feb Winter)
- **Dark overlay**: Gradient overlay ensures white text is always readable over any image
- **Large display**: 280px tall header with prominent time, date, weather icon, and temperature
- **No setup required**: Works immediately with bundled images, customize only if desired

#### View Modes

WeatherPulse offers four distinct forecast view modes to match your dashboard style and information density preferences:

**Compact Mode:**
- Minimal space usage with small forecast cards
- Perfect for smaller dashboards or when space is limited
- Shows essential info: day/time, icon, high/low temps
- Cards are tightly spaced for maximum density
- Temperature gradient backgrounds for quick visual reference

**Standard Mode:**
- Balanced information display with moderate sizing
- Clean row-based layout with border dividers
- Shows day/time, icon, conditions, and temperatures
- Comfortable spacing for easy reading
- Default mode - works well for most use cases

**Detailed Mode:**
- Maximum information display with larger cards
- Additional weather details per forecast item
- More padding and spacing for comfortable viewing
- Best for large dashboards or TV displays
- Shows extended forecast information

**Chart Mode:**
- Visual temperature trend display
- Line graph showing temperature changes over time
- TV weather broadcast style
- Perfect for quickly seeing temperature patterns
- Works with both daily and hourly forecasts

Select your preferred view mode in the visual editor under "View Mode" or via YAML with `view_mode: compact | standard | detailed | chart`.

#### Moon Phase Display

When enabled (on by default), the weather icon on clear nights will display the **actual current moon phase** instead of a generic moon icon.

**How It Works:**
- Reads the `sensor.moon_phase` entity from your Home Assistant installation
- Detects when weather condition is `clear-night`
- Replaces the generic moon icon with one of 8 accurate moon phase icons
- Updates automatically as the moon phase changes throughout the month

**Moon Phases Supported:**
- 🌑 **New Moon** - Moon is not visible
- 🌒 **Waxing Crescent** - Thin crescent growing
- 🌓 **First Quarter** - Half moon, right side lit
- 🌔 **Waxing Gibbous** - More than half lit, growing
- 🌕 **Full Moon** - Fully illuminated
- 🌖 **Waning Gibbous** - More than half lit, shrinking
- 🌗 **Last Quarter** - Half moon, left side lit
- 🌘 **Waning Crescent** - Thin crescent shrinking

**Requirements:**
- Home Assistant `sensor.moon_phase` entity (usually auto-created)
- Weather condition must be `clear-night` (clear skies at nighttime)
- Animated icons must be enabled (default)

#### Holiday Themes

Automatically add festive decorative icons to your weather card during holidays! When enabled, the card displays a sophisticated multi-layer holiday decoration system with custom layouts for each holiday.

**How It Works:**
- Automatically detects the current date and displays decorations during holiday periods
- **Two-Layer System**: Background floating icons + foreground static cluster
- **String Lights**: 12 animated bulbs with visible wire across the top (holiday-specific colors)
- **Custom Positioned Layouts**: Each holiday has strategically placed icons (no random positioning)
- **Icon Rotation**: Some holidays feature rotating characters (e.g., witch → vampire → zombie)
- Gentle floating animation on background icons for festive movement
- Completely optional - toggle on/off in settings

**Decoration System:**

Each holiday features up to 3 decoration layers:

1. **String Lights** (Top Edge)
   - 12 bulbs with connecting wire across header
   - Holiday-specific colors and bulb styles
   - Staggered glow animation
   - Christmas uses long traditional bulbs, others use round bulbs

2. **Background Floating Icons** (Strategic Positions)
   - 5-6 themed icons positioned in specific zones
   - Gentle floating animation with staggered delays
   - Semi-transparent to not obstruct weather data
   - Custom layouts avoid center area (weather icon/text)

3. **Foreground Static Cluster** (Bottom-Left Corner)
   - 3 main holiday icons in compact arrangement
   - Larger center icon flanked by smaller icons
   - Static position for consistent branding
   - Example: Halloween shows pumpkin, gravestone, and candy

**Supported Holidays:**

| Holiday | Dates | String Lights | Foreground Cluster | Background Icons | Special Features |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 🎃 **Halloween** | Oct 25-31 | Orange & Purple | Pumpkin, Grave, Candy | Bats (2), Spiders (2), Ghost, Web | Rotating character: Witch → Vampire → Zombie |
| 🎄 **Christmas** | Dec 18-25 | Red, Green, Yellow (long bulbs) | Tree, Snowman, Gift | Snowflakes (2), Stars (2), Reindeer | Rotating character: Santa → Elf |
| 🎆 **New Year** | Dec 31 - Jan 1 | Gold, Silver, Blue | Firework, Champagne, Party Hat | Fireworks (2), Sparkles (2), Party Poppers (2) | - |
| ❤️ **Valentine's Day** | Feb 13-14 | Pink, Red, White | Heart, Rose, Cupid | Red Hearts (2), Two Hearts, Heart w/ Arrow, Sparkling Heart | - |
| 🍀 **St. Patrick's Day** | Mar 17 | Green, Gold, White | Shamrock, Pot of Gold, Clover | Rainbows (2), Green Heart, Leprechaun Hat, Gold Coin | - |
| 🐰 **Easter** | Mar 25 - Apr 10* | Pastel (Pink, Yellow, Blue, Lavender) | Bunny, Egg, Chick | Tulips (2), Hatching Chick, Bouquet, Cherry Blossom | - |
| 🇺🇸 **4th of July** | Jul 4 | Red, White, Blue | Flag, Firework, Star | Fireworks (2), Stars (2), Party Popper, Confetti Ball | - |
| 🇲🇽 **Cinco de Mayo** | May 5 | Red, White, Green | Mexican Flag, Taco, Cactus | Cacti (2), Trumpet, Party Popper, Confetti Ball | - |

*Easter dates vary yearly; decorations shown as approximation.

**Features:**
- **Automatic Detection** - No configuration needed, just enable the feature
- **Multi-Layer Design** - String lights, floating icons, and static cluster work together
- **Custom Layouts** - Each holiday has hand-crafted icon placement
- **Icon Rotation** - Dynamic character changes every 10 seconds (Halloween, Christmas)
- **Z-Index Layering** - Decorations never obstruct weather icon or important information
- **Animated Elements** - Floating, glowing, and rotation animations
- **Respects Dark Mode** - Works seamlessly in both day and night themes

Toggle "Enable Holiday Themes" in the visual editor's Display Options section.

**Example:**
During Halloween week (Oct 25-31), you'll see orange and purple string lights across the top, a pumpkin/grave/candy cluster in the bottom-left, and floating bats, spiders, ghosts, and a rotating witch/vampire/zombie character throughout the header!
